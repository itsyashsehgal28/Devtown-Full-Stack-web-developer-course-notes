// React Js can have 2 extensions :    .js(javascript)  &&  .ts(typescript)

// also instead of js we can use .jsx extension (Javascript XML file)  ---> combo of Javascript + Html file

// since we have done a lot of projects in js we will be using and learning TYPESCRIPT now for React 

// TYPESCRIPT : not much different than js , its ES6 (ecma script es6) script which is built on JS6 version of Javascript

/* 

    SPA - Single Page Application ---> on click of any link or button the page url should not change 

    Since everything is present in 1 page or 1 file it should take a lot of time to load but react or angular or vue js
    dont let us waste this time by dividing the page into components , different components , it will only provide 
    that component which is needed at that time or rendering only those things that are needed 

    Eg: Gmail , Instagram

/*
    Things we have in React : 
    --->    Components   : Group Codes together to form components

    --->    Data Binding : Binding Data With respect to your component 
                           Uni-Directional Flow of Data

                           Uni-Directional means the flow of data is from parent element to child element not vice-versa
                           Eg: home.jsx ---> navbar.jsx ----> aboutus.jsx 
                           We Cannot Go the other way hence uni directional flow of data

    --->    Virtual DOM  : In DOM operations in JS if we change an element whole page gets refreshed but in virtual DOM
                           only the element gets refreshed , no need to load the whole page 

                           Eg: updated <p> in <body> ----> Virtual DOM ----> DOM ----> Html manipulations reflected on page

    --->
