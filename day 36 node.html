    <title>MERN , Intro to NODE.JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- MERN CONSISTS OF 
        1. MONGO DB - database , very easy will be taught with the project
        2. NODE.JS - built on top of JavaScript used for BUILDING SERVERS (runtime env)
        3. EXPRESS.JS - its a library used with node to reduce the complexity of code , instructions are very clear 
        4. REACT.JS - front end tech      
    -->

    <!-- 3 TIER ARCHITECTURE
        react.js <------< node.js <-------< mongoDB
        react is frontend , node is backend , mongoDB is database 
        react cant communicate with mongo directly so it communicates through node then node communicates to mongo , vice- versa
        
        to communicate between different technologies we use APIs - Application Programming Interface , acts as a middleware
