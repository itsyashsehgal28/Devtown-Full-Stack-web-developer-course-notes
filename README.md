# Devtown-Full-Stack-web-developer-course-notes
# these are the devtown paid classes notes of Full Stack Web Development Course 

# 1. Html and Css as directed in the folders (change the file values according to these folders)

# After referring these notes of HTML and CSS head over to make the "Zomato Clone" and try to apply these learnings it is present in my Github account , notes are there too

# 2. JavaScript is also to be done as directed in the folder

# After JavaScript head over to my Github account and make the "Tasky Application in JS" (learn how to access local storage IMPORTANT)

# After doing frontend , opening the backend is a little bit tricky but easy 

# A package.json file is created so change the server name accordingly to trigger the server you want to use 
# in simple words file name will be server.js so first server.js is node server for second server.js change name to server   back , only 1 server will work at a time  

# Server Creation ---> npm init

# When we need to initialize a repository we use --------> git init 
# When we need to import node packages and use third party packages and libraries like nodemon we use -----> npm init

# Running Server ----> node server.js (whatever the name of the file is here it is server.js)
#                ----> npm start (start is a package)
#                ----> npm run yourScriptName (if you want npm yash it wont work since yash is not a package so npm run yash)
#                ----> npm run dev (with nodemon) (for developers)

# npm i nodemon ----> so we dont need to start the server back again and again after few changes

# 3. Node and Express folder take the contents out to the main /devtown class paste all the files here and run node server first  and then run the express server but paste it first here else it will not work 

# 4. MongoDB there is only 1 day here , if you want to learn mongoDb refer to my other project "Book Record Management"

# 5. ReactJS , i have made my first react js project (yash_react) 4 classes are there and other learnings and typescript will be in the other project "Book My Show Clone" check my Github for the same
